# SQL Server MCP Proof of Concept Plan

## Objective
Build a SQL Server-focused MCP server to validate our understanding of VS Code Copilot Chat's rendering capabilities and test assumptions about UI elements like tables, documentation, and visual components.

## Why SQL Server MCP?

### Perfect Test Case Because:
1. **Tabular Data** - Query results are naturally tabular
2. **Large Result Sets** - Tests performance and pagination
3. **Rich Documentation** - Schema, procedures, help text
4. **Real Business Value** - Immediately useful for the team
5. **Complex Interactions** - Connection management, transactions
6. **Visual Opportunities** - ERDs, query plans, charts

## Core Features to Implement

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Week 1)
```
1. Connection Management
   - Connect to SQL Server
   - Connection string validation
   - Secure credential handling
   - Connection pooling

2. Query Execution
   - Execute SELECT queries
   - Return results as JSON
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Show execution time

3. Schema Exploration
   - List databases
   - List tables/views
   - Show column information
   - Display indexes
```

### Phase 2: Test UI Rendering (Week 2)

6. File Integration
   - Save query results to CSV
   - Link to SQL script files
   - Export schema to files
   - Reference file paths in responses
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
```
7. Visual Elements (Experimental)
   - Query execution plans
   - Simple ERD diagrams (as text/ASCII)
   - Statistics charts (if possible)
   - Test SVG/image embedding

8. Intelligent Features
   - Query optimization suggestions
   - Index recommendations  
   - Performance insights
   - Schema best practices

9. Workflow Tools
   - Generate INSERT statements
   - Create backup scripts
   - Build migration scripts
   - Compare schemas
```

## Technical Implementation

### Tool Structure
```csharp
// Tools to implement
- ConnectTool           // Establish connection
- QueryTool             // Execute queries
- SchemaExplorerTool    // Browse database objects
- DocumentationTool     // Get help and docs

```

### Response Format Testing

#### Test 1: Simple Table Response
```json
{
  "columns": ["ID", "Name", "Email"],
  "rows": [
    [1, "John Doe", "john@example.com"],
    [2, "Jane Smith", "jane@example.com"]
  ],
  "rowCount": 2,
  "executionTime": "15ms"
}
```

#### Test 2: Rich Metadata Response
```json
{
  "table": "Users",
  "schema": {
    "columns": [
      {
        "name": "ID",
        "type": "int",
        "nullable": false,
        "isPrimaryKey": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "documentation": "Stores user information",
  "relatedFiles": [
    "C:/sql/scripts/create_users.sql"
  ]
}
```

#### Test 3: Large Result with Summary
```json
{
  "summary": "Showing first 100 of 5,234 rows",
  "data": [...],
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextToken": "page_2"
}
```

## VS Code Rendering Tests

### What We Need to Validate

1. **Table Rendering**
   - Does VS Code automatically format JSON arrays as tables?
   - How does it handle wide tables?
   - Performance with large datasets?

2. **Documentation**
   - How is multi-line text displayed?
   - Can we use markdown in documentation?
   - Do collapsible sections work?

3. **File References**
   - Are SQL file paths made clickable?
   - Can we link to generated files?
   - How are export locations shown?

4. **Visual Elements**
   - Can we embed images/SVG?
   - How are ASCII diagrams rendered?
   - Is there a way to show charts?

5. **Error Handling**
   - How are SQL errors displayed?
   - Can we provide actionable error messages?
   - How are warnings shown?

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] Connect to SQL Server successfully
- [x] Execute queries and return results
- [x] Results display in a readable format
- [x] File paths are clickable
- [x] Errors are clear and helpful

### Should Have
- [ ] Tables render nicely for small datasets
- [ ] Documentation is well-formatted
- [ ] Schema browsing is intuitive
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Nice to Have

## Next Steps

1. **Create project structure** using COA.Mcp.Framework
2. **Implement ConnectionTool** with secure credential handling
3. **Build QueryTool** with basic SELECT support
4. **Test simple responses** in VS Code Copilot Chat
5. **Document findings** in the reference guide
6. **Iterate based on results**

## Questions to Answer

- How does VS Code handle HTML in responses?
- Can we embed base64 images?
- Is there a row limit for table rendering?
- How are nested objects displayed?
- Can we trigger VS Code commands from responses?
- How do progress indicators work for long queries?

This POC will give us concrete answers about VS Code's capabilities and limitations, allowing us to build better MCP servers for the team.
