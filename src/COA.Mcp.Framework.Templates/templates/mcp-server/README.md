## Adding New Tools

1. Create a new class inheriting from `McpToolBase`
2. Add the `[McpServerToolType]` attribute to the class
3. Add the `[McpServerTool]` attribute to your execute method
4. The tool will be automatically discovered at startup

Example:

```csharp
[McpServerToolType]
public class MyTool : McpToolBase
{
    public override string ToolName => "my_tool";
    public override ToolCategory Category => ToolCategory.Query;

    [McpServerTool(Name = "my_tool")]
    [Description("My tool description")]
    public async Task<object> ExecuteAsync(MyToolParams parameters)
    {
        // Tool implementation
    }
}
```

## Testing

```bash
dotnet test
```
